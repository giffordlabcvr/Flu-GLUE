# Flu-GLUE

This is Flu-GLUE, a GLUE project for the influenzaviruses.

Sequences from the NCBI nucleotide database are curated along with complementary sequence metadata and are integrated together using GLUE - a data-centric software package for capturing virus sequence data and organising it along evolutionary lines (http://glue-tools.cvr.gla.ac.uk/). 

The dataset also contains reference sequences with genome feature annotations, multiple sequence alignments, defined clades and phylogenetic trees, for each influenza virus segment and clade. A new automated genotyping tool for all segments has been developed. The resource may also be used as an offline bioinformatics toolkit. influenza virus-GLUE will help the influenza virus community to study varying aspects of influenza virus biology and evolution and will facilitate the adoption of a nomenclature that more easily distinguishes the properties of influenza virus strains circulating worldwide.
