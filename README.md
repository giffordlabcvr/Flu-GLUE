# Flu-GLUE: Comparative Genomic Analysis of Influenza Viruses

## Overview

Flu-GLUE is a sequence-oriented resource for comparative genomic analysis of influenza viruses, developed using the GLUE software framework. It provides a freely accessible, public-facing platform that offers an automatically-updated, phylogenetically-structured collection of all publicly available influenza sequence data. The data is richly annotated with gene features and linked to a variety of phenotypic information.
